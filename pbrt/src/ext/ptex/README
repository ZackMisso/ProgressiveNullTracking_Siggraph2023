Building with make (Linux):
> make prefix=$PWD/install
> make test
> make install
> make doc

The Makefile uses cmake under the hood.

This will build, install to a local 'install' directory, and
run regression tests.

Contents of install directory:
install/bin:
ptxinfo

install/include:
PtexHalf.h  PtexInt.h  Ptexture.h  PtexUtils.h

install/lib:
libPtex.a  libPtex.so

Note: docs will be generated in the 'src/doc/ptex' directory
and installed as 'install/share/doc/ptex'.
